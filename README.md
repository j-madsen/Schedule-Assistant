# Schedule Assistant

This is a GUI-based application created using Java, Java FX, and MySQL. It is an appointment and customer management system that allows the user to add, modify, or delete appointments and customers. The application connects to a local MySQL database where the data is stored. Local Date/Time functionality is included, as all time is displayed to the user in their local military time. Time is converted and stored in the database in UTC. The user must input valid credentials to access the system, and it will alert the user if there is an upcoming appointment within 15 minutes of the login time. Appointments can be filtered by week, date, or month. Specific reports can be generated displaying the number of appointments by month and type, appointments by the contact, and customers by their country location. Overlapping appointments and appointments outside of business hours (set from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. EST) are not allowed. A text file is also generated tracking login activity. The Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern was utilized to develop the application.
